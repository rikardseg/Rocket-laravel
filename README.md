## Code Review (by Mark Mados and Victor Stranne)

- routes/web.php, L31 : This route doesn't seem to do anything, perhaps remove it! Same goes with the HomeController.php!
- partials/head.blade.php, L13 : album.css doesn't seem to exist
- RegisterController, L21 : Minimum characters is set to 3... what if you're name is Bo? ;)
- You have implemented bootstrap in a great way, good choice for a backend project!
- welcome.blade.php : Maybe remove the default laravel welcome page :P
- routes/web.php L28 : Since you don't have a middleware, you can reach the register page even though you're logged in, add ->middleware('guest') to prevent this.
- Perhaps install clockwork so you can easily monitor your laravel project!
- Great naming of everything lol
- Could be nice to be able to edit your account info, or even delete it!
- When ordering pizza and accidently didn't complete the input form, the error message shows up at the top and is abit difficult to see at first.
- Are you just a badass att typing great indented code or are you using intelephense? either way, good job
- I keep trying to order a banana pizza, but it tells me I order fruit pizza ;Â´(
- DashboardController : doesn't seem to do much except return a view, maybe just do a view in routes/web.php instead.
- LoginController : no validation on the request
- nav.blade.php L41-49 : Weird solution, maybe try and write it abit different. Would be enough with an a-tag or a submit button.
- LogoutTest.php - You're not testing anything
- phpunit.xml, L24-25: renove comments so database doesn't reset everytime you run a test
- In your tests, instead of making a user yourself you could use the User factory.
- You have such a great structure in your project
- head.blade.php, L8 : comment is in swedish
